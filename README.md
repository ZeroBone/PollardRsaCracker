# PollardRsaCracker
This is my implementation of RSA cracking algorithm based on Pollard factorization. It will work if the numbers `p - 1` and `q - 1` that form `n = p * q` (as a part of the public key, `p` and `q` are prime), have no large maximum prime power factors. Of course, all modern RSA implementations don't have this security issue so this is more of an educational project.

# Usage
In order to start the script, simply run `python cracker.py`

You will need 4 inputs:
1. `n` - prime number in the public key so that `m = c ^ d mod n` where `m` is the message, `c` is the encrypted message, `d` is the private key.
2. `e` - the second public key component (so that `gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1`).
3. `c` - the encrypted message.
4. `b` - the maximum prime factor of `n`. This field is optional. However, if you leave it blank, the brute-force algorithm will be used for factorizing `n`.
